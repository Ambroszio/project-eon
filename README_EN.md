# 🌍 Project Eon

**Project Eon** is a 2D medieval fantasy MMORPG currently in development, with a strong focus on deep progression systems and well-defined mechanics from the very beginning.

The project aims to build a solid and scalable technical foundation, prioritizing **real gameplay**, conscious scope decisions, and incremental development.
