# 🔨 Craft System — Project Eon

> Conceptual document adapted from the original vision of Project Eon’s crafting system.
> Defines the **structure, practical flow, and progression** of crafting, using numbers **only as illustrative examples**.

---

## 🎯 Craft System Objective

Crafting in **Project Eon** is a core pillar of player progression.

It allows the player to:

* Progress the character **without relying exclusively on combat**
* Advance solo or cooperatively
* Receive direct rewards (XP + Gold) even without a player-driven market
* Choose clear and identity-defining specializations

---

## 🧠 Core Philosophy

1. Both crafting and combat grant **character experience**
2. Professions have their **own independent levels (skills)**, separate from character level
3. Crafting items grants **profession experience**
4. Delivering orders grants **character experience + gold**
5. Players can choose between:

   * Crafting to level up a profession
   * Completing orders to level up the character

---

## 🧑‍🏭 Profession Structure

### Gathering Professions (4)

* **Miner** — ores and gems
* **Lumberjack** — wood and wood-based materials
* **Fisher** — fish and aquatic items
* **Gatherer / Farmer** — plants, raw food, and natural resources

These professions provide the base materials for the entire crafting ecosystem.

---

### Production Professions (4)

* **Cook**

  * Produces basic and special foods
  * Can grant temporary buffs (attributes, resistances, utility effects)

* **Assembler Technician**

  * Produces furniture, workbenches, and structures
  * Creates utility items (ovens, forges, crafting stations)
  * Produces special trinkets that occupy utility slots

* **Blacksmith / Weaponsmith**

  * Produces weapons for all classes

* **Tailor / Armorsmith**

  * Produces armor, cloaks, and wearable gear

---

## 📦 Order System (Crafting Core)

The order system ensures progression **without mandatory dependence on a player market**.

### How It Works

* While gathering materials, players obtain **Commodity Orders**
* Orders are compatible with the player’s **profession skill level**
* Orders may require items the player **does not personally craft**
* Orders can be:

  * Fulfilled by the player
  * Traded with other players

---

## 🧾 Recipes

Recipes can be obtained through multiple sources:

* Purchased from profession NPCs
* Dropped by creatures
* Quest rewards
* Discovered during gathering activities

Recipes define:

* Required materials
* Required profession
* Minimum skill level

---

## 📈 Profession Progression

* Crafting items grants **profession experience**
* Delivering orders **does not grant profession XP**
* Delivering orders grants:

  * Character experience
  * Gold

To access new gathering areas, recipes, and higher-tier orders, players must **level up their profession skill**.

---

## 🔁 Practical Crafting Loop

1. Gather materials
2. Obtain orders
3. Craft required items
4. Deliver orders to the profession NPC
5. Gain character XP + gold
6. Improve profession skill through crafting

### Rewards (Example)

* Character XP + Gold
* Lumberjack, Miner, and Blacksmith XP gained through crafting

The player chooses whether to:

---

## ⚖️ Balancing Guidelines

* Crafting is never instantaneous
* Progression is gradual
* Specialization is rewarded
* Cooperation is encouraged

---

## 🚫 Out of Initial Scope

* AFK production
* Full automation
* Advanced global marketplace systems

---

## 📌 Final Notes

This system is designed to support progression, economy, and character identity from the early stages of **Project Eon**.

Final values and tuning will be defined during MVP development and internal testing.
