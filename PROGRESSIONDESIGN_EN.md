# 📈 Progression System — Project Eon

> Character progression design document.
> This material defines the **philosophy, boundaries, and pacing** of progression, without final balancing numbers.

---

## 🎯 Progression System Objective

Progression in **Project Eon** is designed to support a cooperative MMORPG where **combat and crafting are equally relevant**.

The system allows players to progress by:

* Focusing on combat
* Focusing on crafting
* Combining both approaches

None of these paths is superior — all are **viable, interdependent, and necessary**.

---

## 🧠 Core Philosophy

1. The character has a **global level**
2. This level represents the character’s overall experience
3. Both combat and crafting grant **character experience**
4. Skills have their own progression, but are **capped by the character level**
5. Cooperation is encouraged in a natural way

---

## 🧬 Sources of Experience

The character can gain experience through the following activities:

### ⚔️ Combat

* Defeating creatures
* Facing enemies in dangerous areas

---

### 🧾 Crafting

* Delivering crafting orders

> Important: Crafting items grants **profession experience**, not direct character experience.

---

### 📜 Quests

* Narrative quests
* Delivery quests
* Exploration quests

---

## 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Player Interdependence

The game design organically requires cooperation between different player profiles.

### Natural Player Profiles

* **Combat-focused players**:

  * Access to dangerous areas
  * Protection during gathering
  * Defeating guardian creatures

* **Craft-focused players**:

  * Item production
  * Order fulfillment
  * Economic sustainment

* **Hybrid players**:

  * Versatility
  * A bridge between both playstyles

No player is fully self-sufficient in an efficient way.

---

## 🔗 Parallel Progression

Combat and crafting **progress side by side**.

* Crafting depends on materials obtained in dangerous areas
* Dangerous areas require strong combat-oriented players
* Combat-focused players rely on items produced by crafters

This loop ensures:

* Cooperation
* Trading
* Group formation

---

## 🔒 Limits (Hard Caps)

### Character Level

* The character has a **maximum level**
* Initially, this cap is planned around **level 100**

> The final value may be adjusted throughout development.

---

### Combat and Crafting Skills

* Each skill has its own level
* The maximum level of a skill is **limited by the character level**

#### Example

* Character level 50:

  * Sword skill: maximum 50
  * Mining skill: maximum 50

This system ensures:

* Consistent progression
* Prevents extreme specialization at low levels
* Keeps the character level relevant

---

## 🌊 Soft Caps (Progressive Slowdown)

Progression is not linear.

### Guidelines

* **Early levels**:

  * Fast progression
  * Introduction to core systems

* **Mid levels**:

  * Moderate progression
  * Player choices begin to matter

* **High levels**:

  * Slow progression
  * Content requires cooperation

Soft caps do not block progression — they simply **slow down the pace**.

---

## ⏱️ Progression Pacing

The pacing of progression is designed to:

* Never hard-block the player
* Prevent excessively fast solo progression
* Encourage player interaction

### Player Experience

* Players always feel progression
* Decisions impact the speed of advancement
* Group play is more efficient than solo play

---

## ⚖️ Balancing Guidelines

* No single XP source is mandatory
* Combat and crafting have similar weights
* Specialization is rewarded
* Generalist play is possible, but less efficient

---

## 🚫 Out of Initial Scope

* Infinite progression
* Prestige systems
* Paragon levels

These systems may be evaluated in the future.

---

## 📌 Final Notes

This progression system is designed to sustain the long-term growth of **Project Eon**, promoting cooperation, meaningful choices, and multiple playstyles.

Final values and tuning will be defined during MVP development and internal testing.
